OBSERVATIONS: How Diffusivity Changes the Concentration Profile
============================================================================

Based on the numerical simulations comparing constant diffusivity (D = 1) 
and variable diffusivity (D = 1.1 - x²):

1. WHAT CHANGED:
   
   a) Diffusion Rate and Steady-State Time:
      - With variable diffusivity D = 1.1 - x², the diffusion rate varies
        spatially. At the center (x = 0.5), D = 0.85 m²/s, which is lower
        than at the edges where D is higher.
      - This spatial variation in diffusivity causes asymmetric diffusion
        behavior and can affect the time to reach steady state.
   
   b) Transient Behavior:
      - The concentration evolution shows different rates of change at
        different positions due to the position-dependent diffusivity.
      - At locations where D is lower (near x = 0.5), diffusion is slower,
        causing carbon to diffuse out of the steel region more gradually.
   
   c) Boundary Concentration Evolution:
      - At x = 0.25 (left boundary of steel): The concentration decreases
        from 1 to steady state, but the rate differs between constant and
        variable diffusivity cases.
      - At x = 0.75 (right boundary of steel): Similar behavior is observed,
        showing the impact of diffusivity on mass transport rate.

2. WHAT DIDN'T CHANGE:
   
   a) Final Steady State:
      - Both cases reach the SAME steady-state concentration distribution.
      - At steady state, ∂C/∂t = 0, so the equation becomes:
        ∂/∂x(D(x) ∂C/∂x) = 0
      - With Neumann boundary conditions (zero flux at both ends), the
        steady-state solution is uniform: C = constant throughout the domain.
      - This constant equals the average initial concentration, which is
        conserved due to zero-flux boundary conditions.
   
   b) Conservation of Mass:
      - Total amount of carbon in the system remains constant in both cases
        because of the zero-flux boundary conditions.
      - The integral of concentration over the domain is conserved.
   
   c) Qualitative Behavior:
      - Both systems show diffusion from high concentration (steel region)
        to low concentration (Fe regions), following Fick's laws.
      - The general shape of concentration profiles during evolution is
        qualitatively similar, just with different rates.

3. KEY PHYSICAL INSIGHT:
   
   - The diffusivity affects HOW FAST the system reaches equilibrium, but
     NOT the final equilibrium state itself (given the same boundary
     conditions and initial total mass).
   
   - Variable diffusivity introduces spatial heterogeneity in the transport
     properties, which is important in real materials where diffusivity
     often depends on composition, temperature gradients, or microstructure.
   
   - The implicit numerical scheme successfully handles both constant and
     variable diffusivity, demonstrating its robustness for solving
     diffusion problems with complex material properties.
